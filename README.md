# Local MLX Backend for Claude Code

This project provides a local server that acts as a backend for the **Claude Code** command line coding assistant. It allows you to use open-source models running on your local machine via Apple's MLX framework. Instead of sending your code to Anthropic's servers, you can use powerful models like Llama 3, GLM-4.5-Air, DeepSeek, and more, all running on your Apple Silicon Mac.

This server implements the Claude Messages API format that Claude Code communicates with, redirecting all requests to a local model of your choice.

## Why Use a Local Backend with Claude Code?

- **Total Privacy**: Your code, prompts, and conversations never leave your local machine.
- **Use Any Model**: Experiment with thousands of open-source models from the [MLX Community on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community).
- **Work Offline**: Get code completions and chat with your local model without an internet connection.
- **No API Keys or Costs**: Run powerful models without needing to manage API keys or pay for usage.
- **Full Customization**: You have complete control over model parameters and generation settings.

## How to Set It Up

There are two parts: running the local server, and configuring Claude Code to use it.

### Part 1: Run the Local Server

First, get the proxy server running on your machine.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chand1012/claude-code-mlx-proxy.git
   cd claude-code-mlx-proxy
   ```

2. **Set up the environment:**
   Copy the example `.env` file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   You can edit the `.env` file to customize the model, port, and other settings (see Configuration section below).

3. **Install dependencies:**
   This project uses `uv` for fast package management.

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   uv run main.py
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:8888` (or as configured in your `.env`) and begin downloading and loading the specified MLX model. This may take some time on the first run.

### Part 2: Configure Claude Code

Next, tell your Claude Code extension to send requests to your local server instead of the official Anthropic API.

As described in the [official Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/llm-gateway), you do this by setting the `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` environment variable.

The most reliable way to do this is to **launch your IDE from a terminal** where the variable has been set:

```bash
# Set the environment variable to point to your local server
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8888

# Now, launch Claude Code from this same terminal window
claude
```

Once your IDE is running, Claude Code will automatically use your local MLX backend. You can now chat with it or use its code completion features, and all requests will be handled by your local model.

### Testing the Server

Before configuring Claude Code, you can verify the server is working correctly by sending it a `curl` request from your terminal:

#### Testing the Messages Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-4-sonnet-20250514",
    "max_tokens": 100,
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Explain what MLX is in one sentence."}
    ]
  }'
```

This will return a Claude-style response:

```json
{
  "id": "msg_12345678",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "MLX is Apple's machine learning framework optimized for efficient training and inference on Apple Silicon chips."
    }
  ],
  "model": "claude-4-sonnet-20250514",
  "stop_reason": "end_turn",
  "stop_sequence": null,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 12,
    "output_tokens": 18
  }
}
```

#### Testing Token Counting

You can also test the token counting endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/v1/messages/count_tokens \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-4-sonnet-20250514",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Explain what MLX is in one sentence."}
    ]
  }'
```

This returns the token count:

```json
{
  "input_tokens": 12
}
```

#### Streaming Support

The server also supports streaming responses using Server-Sent Events (SSE), just like the real Claude API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-4-sonnet-20250514",
    "max_tokens": 100,
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Explain what MLX is in one sentence."}
    ],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

This will return a stream of events following the Claude streaming format.

## API Endpoints

The server implements the following Claude-compatible endpoints:

- `POST /v1/messages` - Create a message (supports both streaming and non-streaming)
- `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` - Count tokens in a message
- `GET /` - Root endpoint with server status
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## Configuration (`.env`)

All server settings are managed through the `.env` file.

| `API_MODEL_NAME`      | `claude-4-sonnet-20250514`       | The model name that the API will report. Set this to a known Claude model to ensure client compatibility.                                 |
| `TRUST_REMOTE_CODE`   | `false`                          | Set to `true` if the model tokenizer requires trusting remote code.                                                                       |
